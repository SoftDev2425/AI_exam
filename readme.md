## About

### Data Wrangling / Preparation
- Scraping House Data and ensuring the data includes relevant features.
- Data Cleaning, handling missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the dataset.
- Feature Engineering, creating new features if necessary (e.g., price per square meter).

### Building the Machine Learning Model
- Spliting the data into training and testing sets.
- Choosing a suitable supervised learning algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.).
- Training our model using the training dataset.
- Evaluating our model using the testing dataset and fine-tune hyperparameters if necessary.

### Creating the GUI with Custom-Tkinter
- Input Form: Creating fields for the user to input house features.
- Predict Button: Implementing a button that, when clicked, will use the trained model to predict the house price.
- Output Display: Show the predicted price on the GUI

### Generative AI for House Report
- Using a generative AI model to create a house report based on the features and predicted price.
- Convert the generated HTML report format to PDF.
- Providing a button to download the generated PDF report.

### Problem Statement
Accurate house price predictions are essential for the real estate market.
We want to develop an AI model to predict house prices and a generative AI to assist real estate agents in document creation for the houses.
We hope to answer these research questions:
1. Can AI models predict house prices accurately using features such as zip code, the house type, size, number of rooms, and proximity to amenities?
2. Can a generative AI trained on real estate data create useful documents for real estate agents?

Our hypotheses is AI models can achieve high accuracy in predicting house prices based on relevant features. A generative AI can effectively produce structured documents for real estate agents using data from house sales websites.

### Motivation
The real estate market is complex and influenced by numerous factors. If AI can predict price for a house from these factors, it would be ideal, to implement it to this business area. Reducing workload for real estate agents.
