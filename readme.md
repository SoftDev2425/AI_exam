## About

### Data Wrangling / Preparation
- Scraping House Data and ensuring the data includes relevant features.
- Data Cleaning, handling missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the dataset.
- Feature Engineering, creating new features if necessary (e.g., price per square meter).

### Building the Machine Learning Model
- Spliting the data into training and testing sets.
- Choosing a suitable supervised learning algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.).
- Training our model using the training dataset.
- Evaluating our model using the testing dataset and fine-tune hyperparameters if necessary.

### Creating the GUI with Custom-Tkinter
- Input Form: Creating fields for the user to input house features.
- Predict Button: Implementing a button that, when clicked, will use the trained model to predict the house price.
- Output Display: Show the predicted price on the GUI

### Generative AI for House Report
- Using a generative AI model to create a house report based on the features and predicted price.
- Convert the generated HTML report format to PDF.
- Providing a button to download the generated PDF report.
